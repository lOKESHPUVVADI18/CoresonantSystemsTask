# Todo Application with API Integration

A simple Todo application built using React.js that allows users to manage their tasks. This application integrates with an API to fetch initial tasks and provides features to add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Features

- Display a list of existing tasks, showing the task name and its status (completed or not).
- Initialize the task list with todos fetched from the API.
- Add new tasks to the list with validations to ensure the task name is not empty.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them, with visual distinction for completed tasks.
- Edit the task name by clicking on an edit button/icon next to each task.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Implement a filter or tab functionality to toggle between displaying all tasks and completed tasks.

## API Integration

- The application uses the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos) to retrieve initial task data.
- Each todo object from the API response includes properties like `id`, `title`, and `completed`.
